# Simon
Simon Web Application Project

## What Am I Learning?
The deployment script: ./deployFiles.sh -k ~/CS260/TannerChildKey.pem -h tannerchild.com -s simon

First, I became much more comfortable using git and github to
- Create a repository on GitHub
- Clone that repository to my computer
- Add, Stage, and Push changes to that repository on GitHub
- I learned that when writing HTML it is very useful to use the table tag to make rows of text/items rather than trying to line up divs next to each other.

I now realize that when I wrote (very) basic HTML for another class, I was trying to do too much styling/centering/formating using HTML. It makes much more sense to do it this way, where we have a very clear structure in HTML and will style it when we apply CSS.

I learned how to use LiveServer to view my HTML as I edited it :) That was really nice.

Finally, I realized that I had an error in the deployment script filepath that didn't allow me to deploy my changes to the site. I was able ti fix this and resolve the error.
